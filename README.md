## Basic Architecutre
8 bit (little endian) CPU, with a capability of addressing maximum of 64KB of memory, using a 16bits address bus.

## Registers

#### Program Counter: 
- 16 bit register;
- Points to the next instruction;
<!-- ## Create a project
```
cargo new name_of_the_project
```
## Execution
To start the program, use the following command:
```
cargo run
```
Note: To run properly it terminal needs to be on the main folder of the project.
## Rust Principles
```rust
fn main(){
   println!("hello world!")
}
```
<sub>(1) Simple function on rust</sub>
> Note: When creating a .rs file, the convention is to use snake_case. Which means all spaces on a certain name is replace by underscore. Eg: someFile.rs to some_file.rs
#### Rust Anatomy
###### Logic of a function
The `main` function is the first function to run in every Rust Program.
Rust is indent with 4 spaces not a tab.
When using the `!` in `println!("Hello, world!");` is calling a Rust macro, while without the `!` it would have called a function.
###### Cargo
`Cargo` is a build system and package manager. It's help building code, downloading libraries (dependencies)\
Check cargo version installed:
```
cargo --version
```

## Initial Project Structure

| Name            | Purpose                                       |
| -------         | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Cargo.toml`    | File that contains metadata for the project, and list of depencies/external libraries to use|
| `src/main.rs`   | Contains the main binary.                     |
